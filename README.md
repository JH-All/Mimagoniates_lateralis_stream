## Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
**Aim:** In the present study, we investigated the stomach contents of *Mimagoniates lateralis* (Nichols, 1913) in a blackwater restinga stream of the Atlantic Forest, aiming to identify the main food sources consumed and to verify the existence of ontogenetic variations. **Methods:** Specimens were sampled in January 2024 in the Panema stream, Itanhaém – SP, with the aid of hand nets. The diet of 124 individuals was determined through stomach content analysis, and the Feeding Preference Degree (FPD) was used to measure the importance of the consumed items. **Results:** The proportion of males was significantly higher than that of females (χ2 = 48.59, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in standard length (t = 0.29, p = 0.76) and weight (t = 1.26, p = 0.20) between sexes. The diet comprised 21 food items, among which detritus, plant fragments, and adult Hymenoptera were predominant. Only detritus was classified as a secondary item, with all other items being occasional. Larger fish were more likely to consume adult Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, while smaller fish were more likely to consume items such as Trombidiformes and detritus. **Conclusions:** The results suggest an ontogenetic dietary shift, favoring specific prey and reducing dependence on other food items. The high presence of allochthonous items in the diet of *M. lateralis* highlights the crucial role of riparian vegetation as an indispensable source of food resources. The preservation of riparian forests not only supports the balance of these ecosystems but is also vital for the survival of *M. lateralis*, a species vulnerable to extinction, reinforcing the urgency of conservation actions.
